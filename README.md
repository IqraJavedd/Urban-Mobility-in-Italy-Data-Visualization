# Urban-Mobility-in-Italy-Data-Visualization
Focuses on urban mobility in Italy, with particular attention to commuting patterns

**Introduction**

This project focuses on urban mobility in Italy, with particular attention to commuting patterns to work and school, as well as the availability of local public transport. Urban mobility plays a key role in economic activity, environmental sustainability, and quality of life.

**Source of the Data**
The datasets used in this project were obtained from the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) through the official ISTAT data portal.

**Description of the Data**
The data consists of regional-level indicators related to:

1. Commuting to work
2. Commuting to school
3. Local public transport availability
4. The variables are mainly numerical (percentages or indicators) and categorical (regions, type of municipality).

5. ## Research Question and Hypotheses

**Main research question:**  

How do transport habits differ across Italian regions, and is there evidence of a shift toward more sustainable mobility such as walking, cycling, and public transport?

This main research question aims to analyze regional differences in daily mobility patterns in Italy using official ISTAT data, with a particular focus on sustainable versus non-sustainable transport modes.



**Sub-question Part 1:**  

1.	Which cities show the highest share of cycling, walking, and public transport as main travel modes?

2.	Are there clear North–South or East–West differences in sustainable transport usage?

3.	Do urban regions rely more on public transport while rural ones depend on private cars?


**Hypothesis 1:**

Urban and metropolitan regions are expected to show higher usage of public transport and cycling due to higher population density, better infrastructure, and shorter travel distances.

**Sub-question Part 2:**  

1. How do commuting transport modes differ across Italian areas for work and school?
2. Which transport modes are most used for commuting to work across regions?
3. How does commuting to school differ from commuting to work?

**Hypothesis 2:**  
Commuting to school is expected to show higher levels of walking and lower private car usage compared to commuting to work, reflecting shorter travel distances and different mobility needs.
